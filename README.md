# lattices

lattices is a free (open source) package for lattice algorithms. These are based
primarly on a number of fundamental publications in the area. For an overview
see M. R. Bremner, Lattice Basis Reductions, 2012 and of course the fundemantal
papers, including of course the papers of Lenstra, Lenstra and Lov√°sz which
introduced the LLL algorithm and the work of Fincke and Pohst.
